AGENT 1 BELIEF PROMPT:
====================
Your task to evaluate tasks based on their payoff structures.

Here is the task you need to evaluate:

Task ID: 1
Options:
- A: Upside = 111, Downside = -90
- B: Upside = 92, Downside = -45
- C: Upside = 77, Downside = -15

SYSTEM CONTEXT PROMPT (for both agents):
=======================================
You are participating in an experiment as a representative of a LEGO car manufacturing company. Here's your situation:

CONTEXT:
- You represent a LEGO car manufacturing company
- You are a participant in a paired decision-making game
- Your partner represents another LEGO car manufacturing company
- You can build simple LEGO cars alone, or complex ones through collaboration
- Collaboration is high risk, high reward with potential for large sunk costs if it fails

GAME RULES:
- You will complete several tasks to maximize your points
- Points are earned individually, not shared with your partner
- Points depend on both your decision and your partner's decision
- Each task has 4 LEGO car design options
- Three options (A, B, C) are collaborative designs requiring partner cooperation
- One option (Y) is an individual design with guaranteed points
- If both choose collaborative designs (any combination), you earn the upside
- If you choose collaborative but partner chooses individual, you get the downside
- There's a 5% technical error chance that causes collaboration to fail.
