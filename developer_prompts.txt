AGENT 1 BELIEF PROMPT:
====================
Your task to evaluate tasks based on their payoff structures and a given utility value (u_value).
The minimum required collaboration belief ("u-value"): This technical value is shown on the interface—it's the threshold probability above which collaboration becomes rational.
Here is the task you need to evaluate:

Task ID: 1
Options:
- A: Upside = 111, Downside = -90
- B: Upside = 92, Downside = -45
- C: Upside = 77, Downside = -15
- Y: Guaranteed = 50


Please analyze the options and provide your belief (should be a number between 0 - 100) about which option is the most favorable, considering the u_value.
What is your assessment of the likelihood(belief) (0-100) that collaboration would be successful in this specific task?
Also, provide a brief explanation of your reasoning and also provide a one line sentence that you would like to communicate to the second agent.

Respond in JSON format as follows:
{"belief": NUMBER, "reasoning": "brief explanation of how you arrived at this belief based on the context and options.", "message_to_agent_2": "one line message to agent 2"}


AGENT 2 BELIEF PROMPT:
====================
Your task to evaluate tasks based on their payoff structures and a given utility value (u_value).
The minimum required collaboration belief ("u-value"): This technical value is shown on the interface—it's the threshold probability above which collaboration becomes rational
Here is the task you need to evaluate:

Task ID: 1
Options:
- A: Upside = 111, Downside = -90
- B: Upside = 92, Downside = -45
- C: Upside = 77, Downside = -15
- Y: Guaranteed = 50


You have received the following message from Agent 1:
"[AGENT_1_MESSAGE]"

Please analyze the options and provide your belief (should be a number between 0 - 100) about which option is the most favorable, considering the u_value and also consider the message from agent 1.
What is your assessment of the likelihood(belief) (0-100) that collaboration would be successful in this specific task? And also come up with a one line message that you would like to communicate back to agent 1.
Also, provide a brief explanation of your reasoning.

Respond in JSON format as follows:
{"belief": NUMBER, "reasoning": "brief explanation of how you arrived at this belief based on the context and options.", "message_to_agent_1": "one line message to agent 1"}


AGENT 1 DECISION PROMPT:
=======================
Your task is to make a decision about the given task based on its payoff structures and a given utility value (u_value).

**Your Assessment**: You estimated a [AGENT1_BELIEF]% chance of selecting a collaborative option.
**Partner's Assessment**: Your partner estimated a [AGENT2_BELIEF]% chance of selecting a collaborative option.
**Partner's Message**: "[AGENT_2_MESSAGE]"

**Key Facts**:
- Technical failure risk: [TECH_FAILURE_RATE_PERCENT] percent
- The minimum required collaboration belief ("u-value"):

Choose your car design:
- Designs A, B, or C (collaborative): Higher potential but requires cooperation
- Design Y (individual): Guaranteed [OPTION_Y_GUARANTEED] points

What is your decision based on your assessment, partner's assessment, and partner's message?

Respond in JSON format: {"choice": "A"/"B"/"C"/"Y", "strategy": "collaborative"/"individual", "reasoning": "your explanation"}


AGENT 2 DECISION PROMPT:
=======================
Your task is to make a decision about the given task based on its payoff structures and a given utility value (u_value).

**Your Assessment**: You estimated a [AGENT2_BELIEF]% chance of selecting a collaborative option.
**Partner's Assessment**: Your partner estimated a [AGENT1_BELIEF]% chance of selecting a collaborative option.

**Key Facts**:
- Technical failure risk: [TECH_FAILURE_RATE_PERCENT] percent
- Threshold for profitable collaboration: [U_VALUE_PERCENT]%

Choose your car design:
- Designs A, B, or C (collaborative): Higher potential but requires cooperation
- Design Y (individual): Guaranteed [OPTION_Y_GUARANTEED] points

What is your decision based on your assessment and partner's assessment?

Respond in JSON format: {"choice": "A"/"B"/"C"/"Y", "strategy": "collaborative"/"individual", "reasoning": "your explanation"}


SYSTEM CONTEXT PROMPT (for both agents):
=======================================
You are participating in an experiment as a representative of a LEGO car manufacturing company. Here's your situation:

CONTEXT:
- You represent a LEGO car manufacturing company
- Your partner represents another LEGO car manufacturing company
- You can build simple LEGO cars alone, or complex ones through collaboration
- Collaboration is high risk, high reward with potential for large sunk costs if it fails

GAME RULES:
- You will complete several tasks to maximize your points
- Points are earned individually, not shared with your partner
- Points depend on both your decision and your partner's decision
- Each task has 4 LEGO car design options
- Three options (A, B, C) are collaborative designs requiring partner cooperation
- One option (Y) is an individual design with guaranteed points
- If both choose collaborative designs (any combination), you earn the upside
- If you choose collaborative but partner chooses individual, you get the downside
- There's a 5% technical error chance that causes collaboration to fail
- You have about 60 seconds to decide

KEY INFORMATION FOR THIS EXPERIMENT:
- Payoff structures may influence their actual decision in specific tasks
- Your goal is to maximize your individual points across all tasks

Think strategically about:
- Risk versus reward given the payoff structures
- How the specific payoffs might affect your partner's willingness to collaborate
- Whether the guaranteed option is better given the uncertainties involved
